          <p>Hi! My name is Shruti and I relish the challenge of transforming data into actionable insights,
            seeking innovative solutions that yield tangible impacts. In 2018, a TEDx video introduced me
            to the potential of Machine Learning & AI in detecting medical conditions like breast cancer
            and diabetes at an early stage. This ignited a spark that fueled my curiosity to leverage coding
            and ML to solve diverse challenges across life and software development with practical solutions.<br/><br/>
            
            As a passionate tech explorer, I'm captivated by the realms of backend and frontend development,
            with a growing prowess in Machine Learning. My open-source contributions have honed my ability
            to craft clean, readable, and maintainable code that fostered effective teamwork and progress.<br/><br/>

            Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege to complete a recent internship working on a
            Computer vision project which further sharpened my ML skills. This invaluable experience helps me
            as I currently search for opportunities in the roles mentioned above. I am eager to contribute
            meaningfully within dynamic teams while growing my skill set.<br/><br/>
            
            Apart from coding, I enjoy sharing knowledge through writing articles over Hashnode. When I step away
            from the screen, I find balance in reading Non-Fiction & Indian Mythology books and practicing yoga.
            This blend of continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and mindfulness forms the core of my approach
            to my work in tech! üìö‚ú®
